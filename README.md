# Telestion

Telestion is a ground station software developed by the TelestionTeam for [WÃ¼Space](https://www.wuespace.de/) projects.
We support space related projects by providing a generic ground station for commanding the projects and managing collected 
data. We help the teams during the whole project cycle starting at the development, continuing with a successful launch 
and ending with recovery and post flight analysis.

The ground station is based on a generic modular backend which is provided in the [backend repository](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion). 
The backend handles the data streams, holds the connection and provides interfaces to the experiments. 
The modular system is extended for the requirements of the experiments (e.g. 
[RocketSound](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/RocketSound)).

The frontend for visualising the data and commanding the experiment is located in the 
[client repository](https://github.com/TelestionTeam/telestion-client).
